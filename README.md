# Movie-guessing-game-mini-project
This is a movie guessing game created by me to guess the full name of the movie using random letters taken as input from the user.
This is a fun to play game created using python.
The format is such that the program asks user to enter any letter as an input .
Then it runs on the concept of try and error method .
